          <h2 class="card-header" style="text-align:center;" >Lesson Learned</h2>
          <p class="card-text">
            One of the biggest lessons learned on this project was time management. With the in-experience team member, time was one of the main issues. With the experience of the team manager we know we had to schedule time set deadlines and continue to at meeting them.
            Testing at every stage was a great lesson learned.There was one stage in the project where we keep writing code and was not testing.When we try to run the application there was bugs and it was very hard to find the bugs.we decided to test after every line of code.</p> 
            A great lesson learn after that there was no bugs that did not get crush, Project documentation are very useful and can help to manage the project from start to finish</p>
          </p>

          <h2 class="card-header" style="text-align:center;" >Success</h2>
          <p class="card-text">
            The lesson I learned from this project help me to achieve the biggest success in my life. I have gain experience that I will use in my life to build other project and build them with confidence. Let me show you what I mean.
            With this project i started writng some code but i did not test regularly,and when I run the application I eperience some bug which took me a significant amount of time to figure out the problem.
            After that experience I was testing every line of code I wrote and then the project pick up a flow that make it fun.
        
            That to some people might sound trivail but to me that is like finding a source of energy to work from. 
            This is a experience I can share with others so they wont have to replay the mistake i made
